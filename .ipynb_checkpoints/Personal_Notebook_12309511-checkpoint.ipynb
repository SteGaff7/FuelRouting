    "## 1. Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I will focus on the Atlas class and the use of python dictionaries as a data structure.\n",
    "I will discuss this class and data structure with respect to key these characteristics: Correctness, Speed, Efficiency, Security, Robustness, Clarity, Maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The atlas class brings all other classes together and uses APIs of the other classes to do this. It provides an API to other classes and gives these classes access to certain methods. In reality it represents a dynamic data structure for a company that holds all the airports that the company associates with and the relative distance and costs between these airports. It is dynamic and flexible and only holds data that is needed and as it is needed. It does not waste storage by storing data that is never used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Atlas is a class that must be instantiated once per company. This example uses condor_atlas as the instance of atlas. Each instance has three dictionaries as attributes. These are: airport_dict, distance_matrix and weighted_matrix. Within the distance_matrix and weighted_matrix dictionaries are sub dictionaries for each airport code to achieve the \"matrix\" effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The update method is responsible for taking a list of airport codes and \n",
    "1. creating airport objects for this airport if it does not already exist\n",
    "2. adding the codes to the distance matrix if not already there and all the codes to sub_distance_matrix if not already there for each code\n",
    "3. adding the codes to the weighted matrix if not already there and all the codes to sub_weighted_matrix if not already there for each code\n",
    "\n",
    "The update method uses several atlas getter methods and also uses the setter methods (add and append) to retrieve and change the dictionary attributes. These setter/add methods have strong privacy through python name wrangling.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are reset methods that will clear the dictionaries that are useful for day to day variations such as clearing  the weighted matrix that will vary according to daily currency rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also print methods to show the contents of the dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "The main aims of the atlas class are:\n",
    "- Store all the needed airport objects in an efficient data structure\n",
    "- Maintain a data structure that contains the distances and prices between these airport objects\n",
    "- Encapsulate the above and provide an interface (API) for other classes to interact with such as the best route class that calculates the cheapest route between a list of airports\n",
    "\n",
    "This class achieves all of the above and hence the class is correct in its methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Speed & Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "It is difficult to make any data structure or algorithim both fast and efficient, it is always a toss up between the two. For this problem as a \"class project\" I decided to focus on efficiency of the algorithim due to the small scale of the problem. Below I will present my considerations as to why I made the choices I did for this smaller scale program. I will then discuss how I would implement it if it were a real life problem for a larger scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Complexity for Hash Tables/Dictionary in Python:\n",
    "           Average\tWorst \n",
    "Search\t\tO(1)\tO(n)\n",
    "Insert\t\tO(1)\tO(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "From the python documentation; \"Python’s lists are really variable-length arrays, not Lisp-style linked lists. The implementation uses a contiguous array of references to other objects, and keeps a pointer to this array and the array’s length in a list head structure.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Complexity for Dynamic Array/ Lists in Python\n",
    "            Average\tWorst\n",
    "Indexing\tO(1)\tO(1)\n",
    "Modify\t\tO(1)\tO(1)\n",
    "Search\t\tO(n)\tO(n)\n",
    "Insert\t\tO(n)\tO(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see above the dynamic array has a speed advantage to the dictionary when we know the given index of an object. However in this problem that would require creating a dynamic array (list) of 5000+ length to represent all possible airports in the csv file, as we would need to know the exact permanent location of the airport object in the airport_list.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason I decided to use a lookup table/hash/dictionary and only store airport objects in the dictionary as they were needed. For a small project like this the number of airports could be very low (less than 50). Average/best case scenario for looking up a key in this dict is O(1) and worst case is O(n) (e.g the key collides and ends up in the last possible location of the hash table). Despite the O(n) time complexity, the speed for this small project will still be quite fast as there are not many objects stored in the dict and we will also benefit from high efficiency due to only storing data that is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned, for a large company I would implement the atlas differently.\n",
    "This company would have access to much more processing power and storage. A lot of the same information would be reused daily such as the airport objects and the distance matrix. Neither of these would vary much over the course of a few days.\n",
    "For this reason I would:\n",
    "- Generate all the airports as airport objects from the csv file and store it in a dynamic array (airport_list), I would also assign an ID to each airport object that relates to the index position of this airport object). This list would be a long term data structure that need only be changed when a new airport is built in which case it will be appened at the end and the list will not need be reconstructed as it is a dynamic array.\n",
    "- Create an empty distance matrix using a nested list. As routes are created this matrx will fill. This matrix also can be used over long periods of time as the distances between airports will not change.\n",
    "- Create a weighted matrix using a hash table as above. This will be added to as needed and will need to start from scratch each morning based on that days currency rates. It is unlikely to ever get to large and hence the speed of search even at worst case should stil be quite fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security\n",
    "\n",
    "The atlas uses getter and setter methods and strong privacy to avoid external classes directly manipulating atlas attributes.\n",
    "There are reset methods that will clear the dictionaries that are useful for day to day variations such as clearing  the weighted matrix that will vary according to daily currency rates. However in practice these methods need to be heavily protected to prevent accidental or malicous deletion of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Robustness\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of the error handling for the atlas is handled by other classes that implement it or that the atlas implement it. For instance if atlas attempts to create and airport with an unknown currency then the airport class will default the currency to USD.\n",
    "Also the update method for the atlas class presumes that it is receiving a list of strings. The error handling to ensure this is prior to calling the update method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The atlas class also implements error handling and prints appropriate messages in that case e.g if there is an error creating a distance or price between two airport codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clarity\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of print_dict methods help to clarify how the data is being stored in the atlas object. The purpose and implementation of the atlas class is clear especially with the comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maintainability\n",
    "\n",
    "The maintainability of the atlas class is quite good as it excepts new airport codes and inserts them into the dicts provided they are in the csv files. Similarly for the currencies. As long as the csv files are kept up to date then the atlas class will remain maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Design\n",
    "\n",
    "### Robustness\n",
    "\n",
    "Robustness is discussed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "The atlas class is scalable and accepts any number of airport codes. Similarly to robustness a lot of the scalability is due to other classes and checks prior to the update method being called. For instance the recurssive method can accept any number of airports.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Code\n",
    "\n",
    "This code uses the principles of python OOP especially encapsulation. Hopefully this has already been highlighted but in quick summary:\n",
    "- Use of getter and setter methods\n",
    "- Use of string privacy (name wrangling)\n",
    "- API: interface for the best route class to access the matrices and airport dict. The get_airport, get_distance_between and the get_price_between methods are all APIs for the best route class.\n",
    "- Use of error handling\n",
    "- Comments and print methods for clarity\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Unit Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Attached are tests to test the correctness of the atlas class. If I had more time I would have liked to graph time complexities of access time to the dictionaries with increasing length of the dictionaries. Also reimplement the dicts as dynamic arrays as discussed above and compare speed of access to data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note on unit tests, due to the weighted matrix relying on varying currency rates the test will likely fail as the prices will have changed. A good solution to this would to temporarirly use a static currency dict.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project I wrote the majority of the groups code and as as result I feel that I have a really in depth udnerstanding of how all the classes piece together and how you would go about implementing in a real life situation. I really enjoyed the challenge of writing the recurssive algorithm and definitely have a much better understanding of how to implement recurssion. I also began to try implement a node and graph solution to this problem and found myself making the recurssion aspect much more streamlined on my second attempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "I found it very interesting comparing the different data structures that could be used and trying to justify which one to select. Similarly I have noticed this has crept over into other modules such as software engineering and I fidn myself critically thinking about the data structures I could and should use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some aspects I found challenging were implementing code together as a team especially when classes would change and interfere with other classes e.g not maintainable or scalable. However as we began to implement getters and setters and APIs between the classes it became a lot easier and really emphasized the importance of APIs to keep code maintainable and scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally on completion of this project I have an urge to redo the project and implement many changes and I think this is testament to the learning that I have done and the better understanding that I now have for data structures and algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Things that I did not get time to complete that I would implement:\n",
    "- Graph to compare speed and time complexities\n",
    "- Dynamic arrays instead of dicts\n",
    "- Node and graph solution\n",
    "- Re implement all classes as instance with getters and setters and \"private\" attributes\n",
    "- Static currency dict for unit testing\n",
    "- More in depth unit testing\n",
    "- Caching of data within the best route class\n",
    "- Investigate other caching"
